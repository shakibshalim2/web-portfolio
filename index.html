<h3>Become a web developer</h3>
<p>
Being a web developer is always difficult. It’s a creative job, but one where usually you aren’t the primary stakeholder.
I know how it feels to use your creative juices to perfect a piece of code, only to have someone else ask for a sudden change in a different direction.
So many web developers can relate to that experience.
I’m sbure you know how it feels, too.
